The Airport Data Analysis project focuses on leveraging data to extract insights about airport operations, passenger traffic, flight performance, and delays. By analyzing datasets containing information such as passenger counts, flight schedules, delay reasons, and seasonal trends, the project aims to identify the busiest airports, evaluate on-time performance, and uncover factors affecting operational efficiency. Tools like Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL, and visualization platforms such as Power BI or Tableau are utilized to preprocess the data, perform exploratory analysis, and create visual representations of trends. The insights derived can guide airport management in optimizing resources, improving passenger experiences, and addressing operational bottlenecks, ultimately contributing to more efficient and passenger-centric airport operations.
